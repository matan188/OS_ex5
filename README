REMARKS:
We implemented it according to the instructions.


ANSWERS:
1.a. Each client will have a select that chooses between STDIN
and socket to the server. 
b. The server will save all the sockets that it received from the clients
from when they registered.
The sockets will stay open, then when a new event is created, the server will
inform all the registered clients using the sockets that were saved.


2. We prefer TCP over UDP because the speed of the transfer is 
not very important but the reliability is. 
UDP is fast but not reliable and TCP is reliable but not as 
fast as UDP.

3. Skype (VOIP) and online streaming. The reason is because it not 
very significant if we loose a frame from the streaming video or 
part of the data in the skype conversation. However the speed is a very 
important factor because we wouldn't want to have delays which will 
make the service very low quality.

4. In order to avoid complete data lost, we can save some the data we would 
want to keep on the disk (files or database). This way, if a crash occurs, 
the program can retrieve some of the data.
Of course, this will not backup all the data, for example if a a command has
not finished executed before the crash, we will not recover all the variables 
and the exact state.
